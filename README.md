# CS458_Blockchain_Term_Project

A repository dedicated to our Blockchain term project, Spring semester 2021



### NOTES

Currenty using compiler 0.7.3, it was the most current one when I created the blank project with hardhat. Might want to change that to the one used in the oracle project but not sure.

There is not Apps directory yet for .js projects.

All this does currently is compile a "hello world" contract. Just created this as the fondation to start writing files.


### RUN

```
npx hardhat compile
```
